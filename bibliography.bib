	abstract = {In the context of Turkey's upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections ("se{\textbackslash}c\{c\}im" in Turkish), social media is playing an important role in shaping public debate. The increasing engagement of citizens on social media platforms has led to the growing use of social media by political actors. It is of utmost importance to capture the upcoming Turkish elections, as social media is becoming an essential component of election propaganda, political debates, smear campaigns, and election manipulation by domestic and international actors. We provide a comprehensive dataset for social media researchers to study the upcoming election, develop tools to prevent online manipulation, and gather novel information to inform the public. We are committed to continually improving the data collection and updating it regularly leading up to the election. Using the Secim2023 dataset, researchers can examine the social and communication networks between political actors, track current trends, and investigate emerging threats to election integrity. Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/ViralLab/Secim2023\_Dataset},

Wide us of this language on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, or Tiktok and strategic position of the country in the world politics makes it appealing for the social network researchers and industry. To address this need, we introduce TurkishBERTweet, the first large scale pre-trained language model for Turkish social media built using almost 900 million tweets. The model shares the same architecture as base BERT model with smaller input length, making TurkishBERTweet lighter than BERTurk and can have significantly lower inference time. We trained our model using the same approach for RoBERTa model and evaluated on two text classification tasks: Sentiment Classification and Hate Speech Detection. We demonstrate that TurkishBERTweet outperforms the other available alternatives on generalizability and its lower inference time gives significant advantage to process large-scale datasets. We also compared our models with the commercial OpenAI solutions in terms of cost and performance to demonstrate TurkishBERTweet is scalable and cost-effective solution. As part of our research, we released TurkishBERTweet and fine-tuned LoRA adapters for the mentioned tasks under the MIT License to facilitate future research and applications on Turkish social media. Our TurkishBERTweet model is available at: https://github.com/ViralLab/TurkishBERTweet},

More specifically, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based TF-IDF procedure. BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

	abstract = {BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

In particular, emerging data-driven approaches relying on topic models provide entirely new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However, the short, text-heavy, and unstructured nature of social media content often leads to methodological challenges in both data collection and analysis. In order to bridge the developing field of computational science and empirical social research, this study aims to evaluate the performance of four topic modeling techniques; namely latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. In view of the interplay between human relations and digital media, this research takes Twitter posts as the reference point and assesses the performance of different algorithms concerning their strengths and weaknesses in a social science context. Based on certain details during the analytical procedures and on quality issues, this research sheds light on the efficacy of using BERTopic and NMF to analyze Twitter data.},

We address the research questions of what futures Twitter's futurists anticipate and share, and how these anticipated futures can be modeled from social data. To investigate this, we review related works on anticipation, discuss the influence of language markers and prestigious individuals on anticipatory thinking, and present a taxonomy system categorizing futures into "present futures" and "future present". This research presents a compiled dataset of over 1 million publicly shared tweets by future influencers and develops a scalable NLP pipeline using SOTA models. The study identifies 15 topics from the LDA approach and 100 distinct topics from the BERTopic approach within the futurists' tweets. These findings contribute to the research on topic modelling and provide insights into the futures anticipated by Twitter's futurists. The research demonstrates the futurists' language cues signals futures-in-the-making that enhance social media users to anticipate their own scenarios and respond to them in present.

The mistakes made in some of the policies that started to be implemented with January 24, 1980, stabilization program, the seeds of the 1994 economic crisisEconomic crisis began to be planted. Financial liberalizationFinancial liberalization and liberalization in foreign trade in the following period resulted in the Turkish economy, which was not yet ready, to face a crisis. This chapter aims to give detailed information about the 1994 Economic CrisisEconomic crisis that occurred in Turkey. In the study, the place of the 1994 economic crisisEconomic crisis in the literature and the reasons for its emergence were tried to be explained in detail. With the onset of the crisis, its effects on the country's economy were revealed, and the exit strategy from the crisis was explained. While explaining the causes and effects of the crisis, some economic indicator figures before and after the crisis were used. In this context, data sets such as growth, foreign trade, interest rate, international reserveİnternational reserves amount, foreign capital inflowCapital inflows and outflow figures, inflation, and exchange rate were used for certain periods between 1980–1994. Although there are many factors that led to the 1994 economic crisisEconomic crisis, each one has a different effect and cannot be said to have caused the crisis on its own. Intense short-term speculative capital inflowsCapital inflows to the capital markets with the financial liberalizationFinancial liberalization, the deterioration of the current account balance as a result of the overvaluation of the Turkish lira, the unsustainable level of public deficitsPublic deficits, high inflation, excessive public debtPublic debt and public sector borrowing requirementPublic sector borrowing requirement, attempt to keep treasury borrowing rates below market rates, open positionsOpen position of banks, decrease in international reservesİnternational reserves of the Central Bank, borrowing from the Central Bank to finance public deficitsPublic deficits can be counted among the main causes of the crisis. The 1994 economic crisisEconomic crisis, which was one of the deepest crises in the 90s, caused the country's economy to shrink by as much as 6\%, the national currency to depreciate excessively, inflation to hyperinflation levels, and overnight interest rates to reach astronomical levels. As the exit strategy from the crisis, the economic decisions of April 5, 1994, were announced, and the policies expected to eliminate the effects of the crisis in theory began to be implemented. Unfortunately, April Economic Stability ProgramEconomic stability program did not provide a permanent stability and recovery in the economy and could not prevent the emergence of new economic crises in the medium and long term, because the necessary structural reforms were not fully made and implemented decisively.},

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s personality and style have come to embody the Turkish nation, the state and its economic, social and political institutions. But what is Erdoganism? What are its main attributes? Is it a mere ideology or the name of the emerging political regime in Turkey? While commentators have provided several observations of Erdoganism, it has not been duly examined on its own in the academic literature. This paper’s main premise is that in Turkey, a new political regime has emerged in recent years which can best be defined as Erdoganism. Erdoganism has four main dimensions: electoral authoritarianism as the electoral system, neopatrimonialism as the economic system, populism as the political strategy and Islamism as the political ideology. We first explain why we think Erdoganism is a better concept to define the emerging political regime in Turkey. We briefly discuss Sultanism, Khomeinism and Kemalism in order to produce a set of references for our discussion of Erdoganism. We then provide a thorough analysis, explaining the ways in which Erdoganism manifests itself through electoral authoritarianism, neopatrimonialism, populism and Islamism.},

This study provides a descriptive account of uncivil interactions between citizens and politicians on Twitter. We develop a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of incivility at three distinct levels: macro (temporal), meso (contextual), and micro (individual). Using longitudinal data from the Twitter communication mentioning Members of Congress in the United States across a time span of over a year and relying on supervised machine learning methods and topic models, we offer new insights about the prevalence and dynamics of incivility toward legislators. We find that uncivil tweets represent consistently around 18\% of all tweets mentioning legislators, but with spikes that correspond to controversial policy debates and political events. Although we find evidence of coordinated attacks, our analysis reveals that the use of uncivil language is common to a large number of users. }

The findings suggest that public diplomacy remains to be the diplomacy of the government, not of the public, and social media is used as just another tool for propaganda, not as a means of engagement with foreign publics. Further, the findings indicate the emergence of a “new” cult of personality in public diplomacy and point out the instrumental role of social media in changing the dynamics of leader-follower relationship.

In a quest to increase their effectiveness, states are applying relationship management and pursuing a more relational {PD} approach with publics. However, present understanding of relationships may be one-sided, focusing primarily on the state's relationship-building activities and overlooking the public's agency in defining relations. This paper uses relationalism as an analytical lens to construct a 4-quadrant model of public diplomacy based on the relational dynamics between a state and publics. The model reveals a parallel evolution of communication technology and public diplomacy initiatives that move from assumptions of no relations with publics, to favorable relations, to adversarial relations. A case study from Turkey is used to illustrate how diverse groups can use social media to form unlikely alliances to become a fluid, adversarial public capable of ‘going for the jugular’ and challenging state legitimacy. Aggressive separation tactics by the state to counter adversarial publics can inadvertently create a ‘relational paradox’ that leaves the two parties more politically divided and yet more relationally intertwined. The study implications stress the need for states to monitor their relational dynamic with publics as a precursor for developing reflective strategies.},

	abstract = {As social movements relying on the weak ties found in social networks have spread around the world, researchers have taken several approaches to understanding how networks function in such instances as the Arab Spring. While social scientists have primarily relied on survey or content analysis methodology, network scientists have used social network analysis. This research combines content analysis with the automated techniques of network analysis to determine the roles played by those using Twitter to communicate during the Turkish Gezi Park uprising. Based on a network analysis of nearly 2.4 million tweets and a content analysis of a subset of 5126 of those tweets, we found that information sharing was by far the most common use of the tweets and retweets, while tweets that indicated leadership of the movement constituted a small percentage of the overall number of tweets. Using automated techniques, we experimented with coded variables from content analysis to compute the most discriminative tokens and to predict values for each variable using only textual information. We achieved 0.61 precision on identifying types of shared information. Our results on detecting the position of user in the protest and purpose of the tweets achieved 0.42 and 0.33 precision, respectively, illustrating the necessity of user cooperation and the shortcomings of automated techniques. Based on annotated values of user tweets, we computed similarities between users considering their information production and consumption. User similarities are used to compute clusters of individuals with similar behaviors, and we interpreted average activities for those groups.},
