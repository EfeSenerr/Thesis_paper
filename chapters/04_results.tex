\chapter{Results}\label{chapter:results}

As explained in the previous chapter, this thesis follows several topic modeling approaches to 
obtain the most representative result that can be analyzed. To emphasize the approaches again, 
the first approach follows Martin's general recommendations and does not change any arguments. 
This BERTopic approach delivers around 7500 topics, which is too much to analyze and make sense 
of the results. 

The main reason behind the mass number of topics is \texttt{min\_cluster\_size} remaining at 20, 
allowing around five thousand topics with less than five thousand tweets. The other main reason 
is the diversity of the analyzed data. To determine the topics, sample data of 1\% of all collected 
tweets is used from a dataset that contains more than 200,000 daily tweets. 
When manually looking at the data, one can realize that even though the size is small, the topic 
can be related to a real-life event. Nevertheless, on the other hand, most of the topics can be 
combined or be in the outlier category.

With the experiences from the first approach, the second approach tries to minimize the 
cluster size of the topics to obtain a better result. When the \texttt{min\_cluster\_size} remained 
at 100, around 1000 topics were returned from the topic model. Similar to the first approach, 
this approach also covered the most significant topics. Because the cluster sizes are bigger 
with this approach, the topics are more challenging to label and categorize in one area. Although 
one can realize the similarities between these approaches in the top eight representative words, 
the representative tweets differ. These representative tweets are used in OpenAI prompt to label 
the topics, so the quality of these tweets is of high importance. In this approach, most 
representative tweets include three similar long texts with a high proportion of hashtags and 
mentions. That is also why almost half of the top 20 topics are demands or requests from the 
government, where many users and bots spam almost similar tweets to put the topic in trends, 
promoting politicians, parties, and specific agendas \parencite{secim2023}.
% add additional information here about bots and etc 

After considering these arguments, this thesis mainly analyzes the results of the first approach, 
where one can realize topic trends consisting of specific topics that make comparing and analyzing 
the results considerably more straightforward.

It is essential to mention that outliers are not mentioned via graphs but are remembered 
during the results. Although some approaches in this tried to redistribute outliers, outliers 
exist for a reason. As Grootendorst notes, outliers are to be expected, and pushing the 
output to have no outliers may not correctly represent the data. 

One disadvantage of following the default pipeline of BERTopic is that when the model is first trained, 
the biggest cluster is usually the outliers. However, when training the model and transforming 
the rest of the data, the outlier cluster is considered a usual topic cluster like any other. 
For instance, during one of the approaches, the model had more tweets in the outlier cluster 
while training than after transforming all the collected data, which might, on the one hand, 
cause lots of meaningless topics and, on the other hand, not accurately represent the data. 
There are several new approaches that BERTopic supports that overcome that issue. 
One can try \textit{Online Topic Modeling} to incrementally train the model, or 
\textit{Merge Multiple Fitted Models} approach, where multiple models are trained and, in the end, 
merged so that no information is lost. These approaches are discussed in~\autoref{section:future_work}.
% 

The top results of the topic modeling are presented in \autoref{tab:topic_modeling_results_1}, 
ordered by the number of tweets in the clusters. The \autoref{tab:topic_modeling_results_1} shows 
the topic labels on the left and their respective topic's eight representative words on the right. 
Although it would be hard to translate the representative words, the labels are labeled and then 
translated by GPT-4 Turbo for better interpretation. 

The top 15 topics represent various themes around Turkish political discourse. These topics include 
general political discussions, praise and criticism of both ruling and opposition parties, 
wishes and demands from the government, and the earthquake disaster.

\end{table}

Before diving deeply into the topics and understanding the big picture, clarifying some topics 
for better context would be beneficial. Topics like \textit{Political Discussions}, 
\textit{Political Discussions \& Critism}, \textit{Critism of Political Figures},  

\textit{Praise of Political Figures} are more general and include tweets with positive and 
negative sentiments towards both the ruling and the opposition parties. 
One can realize that the representative words of the first topic include Twitter user names, 
which are active accounts that share news mainly about the elections. A high number of replies 
and a high level of interaction with their tweets made this category the most noteworthy.

However, topics like \textit{Opposition Candidates}, \textit{Opposition Coalition \& Criticism}, 
\textit{Opposition Figures \& Preferences} and \textit{Erdogan's Election Chance} focus on and 
express opinions about specific target groups, either the ruling party or the opposition parties 
and their candidates. 

It is hard not to notice the fourth biggest cluster \textit{Religious Wishes}, which includes 
tweets that cover aspects of prayer and Islam. While most of the representative sentences show 
tweets expressing condolences to various political figures who have lost their relatives, many 
of these tweets also include phrases of support and sympathy, such as \textit{'God bless you'}, 
underlining solidarity.

The label \textit{Treason Accusations} might sound absurd. The main reason for that is, again, 
the representative tweets that include some accusation against the political figures, 
blaming them with extremes like committing treason or being a terrorist. As one of the largest 
clusters, topics like this illustrate the polarization within the Turkish political landscape, 
which has been prominent over the years \parencite{cevik_turkey_polarization_2018}. 
Another topic in this table, \textit{Provocation \& Discussions}, also highlights the 
polarization level in the Turkish Twitter political discourse. The representative tweets are 
aggressive and show a high level of emotions.

\textit{Erdogan \& Nationalism} topic and its representative words show a significant degree 
of nationalist ideas. The label itself includes Erdogan because of the representative tweets 
mentioning Erdogan and the tenth representative word \textit{Erdogan}, which is not seen in the table. 
However, it is essential to mention that both the opposition and ruling party coalition 
include parties based on Turkish nationalism that played a significant role in May 2023 
elections, parties being \ac{IyiP} and \ac{MHP}.

Although it is more explicit in other topic modeling strategies that this thesis tried, 
one can also see the volume of topics like \textit{Teachers \& Demands} and \textit{Earthquake \& Demands} 
in \autoref{tab:topic_modeling_results_1}. The role of Twitter in the latter topic is crucial. 
Because of the earthquake on 6 February, all controversial telecommunication lines were disrupted, 
where Twitter has been widely used for rescue operations \parencite{cevik_aksoy_turkey_earthquake_2023}.

All these mentioned topics are deeply analyzed in the following section, with 
graphs supporting understanding of the topics and their trends.

\section{Analysis of data findings}

For simplicity and better understanding purposes, this thesis analyzes the topic modeling results 
in three categories: topics related to the ruling party visualized in \autoref{fig:topics_graph_akp}, 
the opposition visualized in \autoref{fig:topics_graph_opposition}, and the remaining topics 
visualized in \autoref{fig:topics_graph_other}. 

These graphs visualize the selected topics in a normalized monthly distribution. 
Normalization has been done considering the top 50 topics. Otherwise, the interpretation of topics 
and their trends was almost impossible. One can not realize any trends in a frequency graph because 
the \#Secim2023 dataset is not collected equally between months, demonstrated in \autoref{fig:collected_tweets}.

In all these graphs, the biggest cluster \textit{Political Discussions} is shown as the baseline 
in a straight blue line to compare these different graphs and analyze the trends more smoothly. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/normalized_akp_selected_topics_distribution_with_styles.png}
    \caption[Normalized monthly distribution of ruling party related topics]
    {Percentage of ruling party related topics in the top 50 topics. 
    The blue line represents the biggest cluster and is the baseline, 
    and the other lines represent topics related to Erdogan and the ruling party.}\label{fig:topics_graph_akp}
\end{figure}

Beginning the analysis with the first graph~\ref{fig:topics_graph_akp}, 
it covers the monthly distribution of the ruling party and Erdogan-related topics. 
It is essential to acknowledge the baseline topic \textit{Political Discussions}, 
keeping its importance in the months to elections, massively increasing after the start of 2023 up 
to more than 10\% of the top 50 tweets. That is normal, considering that in the months leading up 
to the elections, almost all the news was political, and rallies around Turkey were happening daily. 
Undecided opposition candidacy, hot topics like the economic crisis and migration policy, and 
uncertainties in domestic and foreign policies led social media to a political discussion hub.

Having the baseline topic covered, the next topic with a green dotted line covers the topic 
\textit{Erdogan \& Nationalism}. As mentioned previously, it is essential not to converge Turkish 
Nationalist ideas with Erdogan and the AKP regime. There are nationalism-based parties in both the 
opposition and the ruling coalition. The opposition coalition's name is even `Nation Alliance', 
in other words, the `Table of Six'.

Turkish Nationalism has always been one of the base ideas of Turkish politics since the republic's 
foundation. The reason for that is now the opposition and once the founding party, \ac{CHP}, who laid 
Turkey's six founding fundamental ideologies called the `Six Arrows'. 
One of the \textit{arrows} represents Nationalism. However, as Hotelling's model suggests, 
throughout the years, because CHP's idealogy moved more toward the left wing, parties like AKP or 
newly established parties like ZP started to fill the empty right-wing spots \parencite{caramani_comparative_politics_2020}. 
Representative tweets showing support for different political figures using nationalist 
ideas also underline this aspect. 

The migration policy was one of the hottest topics of the May 2023 elections. 
The government's attitude of welcoming more than six million refugees while getting funding from the 
European Union for this purpose sparked lots of tensions amongst different ideologies and parties. 
In 2021, a new party called the \ac{ZP} was formed from the ranks of the opposition. 
It then rapidly increased its popularity as a mainly single-issue party focused on expelling refugees 
back to their countries \parencite{berk_esen_turkish_politics_2023}. \ac{ZP} formed the second opposition 
coalition against Erdogan, and their candidate received more than 5\% of the votes. 

These events highlight why Nationalism has been one of the most trending topics during the months up 
to the election. However, in the new year, more specifically after the 6 February earthquake, other 
topics gained more significance.

One of the topics that gained relatively more importance is the \textit{Criticism of Political Figures}, 
visualized as a red dotted and straight line in \autoref{fig:topics_graph_akp}. On the other hand, 
the topic \textit{Praise of Political Figures}, visualized as a turquoise dotted line, has lost volume 
in time. The main explanation for that is the 6 February earthquake, which immediately changed 
the course of the elections by changing everybody's attention towards the southeast of Turkey. 

The following reasons, also underlined by \textcite{cevik_aksoy_turkey_earthquake_2023}, can explain 
the change in the trends of these topics, where criticism outweighed the praise of political figures 
on Twitter. The system lacked law enforcement until the earthquake, where the 
contractors of the building constructions sought to maximize their profits. 
The weakened state capacity led to the slowness of emergency response during the catastrophe. 
The military was missing, and there were no plans against this kind of emergency, or in other words, 
if there was a plan, it was not executed. 
NGOs and volunteers started to organize themselves and worked together for days. Twitter was always 
the central platform for the organizations and cry for help. Nonetheless, the government slowed down 
Twitter to prevent `disinformation' from spreading, which worsened this process.

The last topic in this graph is \textit{Erdogan's Election Chance}, visualized by a pink straight line. 
It can be seen that this topic remained relatively low and reached the bottom rock during the month 
of the earthquake, and in March, it increased a lot and outranked the other two topics in the election 
month. The reasons for this increase will be discussed thoroughly in \autoref{fig:topics_graph_opposition}. 
However, in short, the lack of collaboration and not being decisive about a candidate among the 
opposition ranks make this increase feasible.
