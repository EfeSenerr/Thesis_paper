\section{The Methodology}
Due to time constraints and the time plan of this thesis, only the BERTopic model 
is used for topic modeling. Since several methods could be used, it is important 
to mention why BERTopic is used and why the others are not.
\textcite{topic_model_comparison_bertopic_2022} mentioned that for short and 
unstructured texts like Twitter data, BERTopic can extract contextual information, 
and it offers the most potential compared to different embedding-based topic models like Top2Vec.
