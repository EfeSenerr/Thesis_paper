I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Carolin Schuster,
for her continuous support, guidance and patience throughout this thesis.
Without her help, this thesis would not have been possible.

I am thankful to the Research Group Social Computing for providing me
computational resources, which helped me collecting the Twitter data.  

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support,
belief and encouragement throughout my academic journey.
